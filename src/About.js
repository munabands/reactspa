        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Joel Umunna is a young junior developer I am 22, I like history and
          programming, I think they are the coolest subjects to learn about. My
          favorite programming language is Reactjs & Swift.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like other things outside computer science, like business but I
          mainly like coding and making programmes. I just want to work with
          real developers and help make projects for clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a lot of faith in my abilities, and want to continue to grow
          and learn more techniques to make cool sites and applications, much
          cooler than this very basic site.
        </p>
