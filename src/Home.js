        <p>
          Hello and thank for looking at my React Single-Page-Application. I am
          an eager developer with skills in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript (Reactjs and
          Vuejs). I have other skills but these our my main skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once again please forgive me for this site being bare and a bit dull,
          I am working on more complex projects with more advanced logic.
          However I am eager to learn more and this is a great starting point
          for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am on course to be a proficient full-stack developer, however I am
          still working on my backend skills. Hence why I haven't got any full
          stack projects on my porfolio. But I am still picking up skills like
          server side rendering to help SEO with Next.js
        </p>

        <p>feel free to contact me email munabands@gmail.com</p>
